# The Shoppies 

You made it here! 

Since you're here, you can learn a bit more about how I pulled this off while listening to @Porter Robinson's Nurture Live set on repeat in less than 24 hours. 
Rough week for me so hard to find time to work on it. But happy I finished!

# Why certain things

I chose to do queries onSubmit instead of having them query live. This gives performance benefits and scales better. Imagine having one user make n number of queries
everytime they made n key presses. Then scale this up to n users. Ouch, rip omdb. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [TailWind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
React has great state management and I think is absolutely neccesary for this project to work. TailWind is just nice because it allows me to quickly do UI given the very short time frame. 


# Improvements

If I had more time, I would list the search results as a drop down below the search bar, then have the nominations laid out in the main body of the webpage. 
This is because nominations are ultimately the most important part of the app and I want to highlight it (its quite literally the purpose.)
Haven't done it before so I didn't want to risk not finishing a feature on time and would rather spend time making it work better.
